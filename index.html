        <h2>Engineering the Self</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Engineering the Self</b> is not a fitness book.
            It is not a motivational memoir.
            And it is not another guide that tells you to “try harder.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the story of a system that looked functional from the outside—disciplined, compliant, consistent—yet kept producing incoherent results. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Told through the lens of systems engineering by an engineer accustomed to diagnosing failure in complex systems, this book chronicles a multi-year personal transformation that defied conventional explanations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite near-perfect execution of diet, training, and discipline, progress stalled. Metrics contradicted reality. Effort stopped scaling. The logs looked clean—but the system behaved as if something deeper was broken.
        </p>
        <p>
            The breakthrough came not from pushing harder, but from diagnosing the architecture itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the core of the story is a realization most self-improvement narratives miss: when a low-level subsystem is compromised, no amount of effort at the surface can compensate. In this case, the silent fault lived at the firmware level—quietly sabotaging metabolism, recovery, fat distribution, and emotional stability for years without ever triggering obvious alarms.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Once that fault was identified and addressed, everything upstream began to change. Not explosively. Not magically. But coherently.
        </p>
         <p>    
            Energy stabilized.
            Recovery began to scale.
            Metrics stopped lying.
            The body stopped fighting discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than a personal journey, Engineering the Self offers a transferable framework for understanding human transformation as a system rebuild:
        </p>
        <p><b>
            Inputs → Processes → Subsystems → Drivers → Metrics → Outputs
        </b></p>
        <p>
            Readers learn why “doing everything right” can still fail, how to distinguish noise from signal, and how to recognize when the real problem is not motivation, nutrition, or willpower—but architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Written with precision, humility, and intellectual honesty, the book is a tribute to correct diagnosis, disciplined execution, and the kind of guidance that sees what effort alone cannot. It is for anyone who has ever asked:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>“Why isn’t this working—when I’m doing everything right?”</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            An examination of assumed limits and discovered constraints.
            Explores how premature conclusions shape identity, effort,
            and long-term outcomes across technical and personal systems.

            <h2>Author</h2>
            <p>
                Soumitra Chatterjee is a systems engineer and writer based in Bengaluru, India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over more than two decades, his work has spanned compiler frontend architecture,
                large-scale software systems, and GPU software enablement for AI and scientific computing.
            </p>
            <p>
                His writing reflects a sustained interest in how systems behave under constraint—
                whether technical, biological, or psychological.
